# Marf's dotfiles

This is mostly for my awful AwesomeWM env.
And now since 2024, i've moved over to Hyprland. based on a set of dotfiles from a good friend of mine :-) and added some features i use.



and some .bashrc stuff. what i still need to clean up but because im lazy. It still contains some debian stuff even though i use arch btw.


if something is wrong, you can open up a Pull Request :-)
